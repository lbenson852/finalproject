        <a href="https://teamsintandem.com/welcome">Tandem</a> is an online tool
        designed to help people function better on teams and to help
        instructors/managers better support those teams. Currently, Tandem is
        being used by student teams in a higher education setting. In the
        future, we hope to expand to teams in other settings, such as secondary
        education and industry. Tandem is being developed by the
        <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/"
          >University of Michigan's Center for Academic Innovation</a
        >.</p1
