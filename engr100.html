      <h2>Engr 100-600 Course Description</h2>
      <div class="overview">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This is a design-build-test-communicate course with a heavy emphasis
          on team-based, project-based, collaborative learning. That mouthful is
          a fancy way of saying: you will gain a lot of introductory-level
          engineering experience by building something interesting with a group
          of people!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          In our section, you will work in a team of five to design, build,
          test, and communicate about a remotely operated vehicle (ROV),
          sometimes called a submersible, for underwater exploration. The ROV
          has a set of tasks that it will need to do, but otherwise this is a
          “free design” project with minimal constraints on size, shape, and
          function. Your team will be provided with raw building materials, four
          thrusters, a blank control box, toggle switches and buttons, and a
          payload consisting of a battery, a video camera (to “see what the ROV
          sees” and help complete the set of tasks), and a tether to a float.
          The float connects wirelessly to a control box that you will design
          and build. You will have an opportunity to test your ROV in the towing
          tank at the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory (MHL) in West Hall. An ROV
          competition is held on a weekend near the end of the semester at the
          MHL. At the competition, your team will present its ROV design to our
          industry sponsor and then conduct final ROV testing in the MHL’s
          towing tank. A written progress report and a final report are also
          deliverables for this project.

        <h3>Lecture, Discussion, and Lab</h3>
        <p>
          This section has a lecture component, a discussion component, and a
          lab component. The lectures are a time when content is provided and/or
          practiced; they are highly group/team-oriented and taught in a
          “studio” style where you sit with your team or other small group.
          Discussions are a time when we provide and practice content that is
          more suitable to a smaller class size. Labs are when you will gain the
          hands-on build and test experience with your team. Throughout the
          course, collaboration is highly encouraged and required. To emphasize
          the importance of collaboration in Engr 100-600, course engagement
          points are assigned to many activities in lecture, discussion, and
          lab. If you miss a lot of class, you will not earn these points, and
          it will be difficult to do well in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your team will use a dedicated lab to construct and test your ROV
          during regular lab times and open lab times provided by the
          Instructional Assistants (IAs) for the class. Peer mentors -- students
          who have previously taken this course -- are assigned to each team to
          provide design guidance and offer support.

        <h3>Course Content and Workload</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of Engr 100-600 is to provide an opportunity for you to gain
          experience in a wide range of engineering skills. Before you get super
          excited that you are going to become an expert hydrodynamicist after a
          single introductory engineering course, we want to remind you that
          this is an intro course. And it’s an intro course that is focused on
          communication and hands-on learning in a general engineering sense. We
          don’t have the time to go deep into any technical content. However, we
          will touch on the following engineering topics within the context of
          the ROV project: team communication and collaboration, 3D modeling and
          printing, pressure, buoyancy, stability, technical documentation
          (presentations and reports), basic electric circuits, systems design,
          probability, statistics, risk, and ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fair warning: Past students generally report that the workload for
          Engr 100-600 is higher than other sections of Engr 100 but that the
          extra work is worth it. More than one of our past students has said
          that they owe a summer internship after their first year in college to
          the experience they could list after taking Engr 100-600.
        </p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Should you take this course?</h3>
        <p>
          This course will likely be of greatest interest to those students
          looking to major in naval architecture & marine engineering, but any
          student who is interested in a rewarding, hands-on introduction to
          engineering at U-M is very welcome. We’ve worked hard to create a
          multi-disciplinary project that will appeal to a wide range of
          students, so hopefully everyone will find something interesting to do!
        </p>

          If you are hoping to register for this section in the fall term but
          find that it is already full, please email the First-Year Programs
          Coordinator, Krista Quinn, at engin-fyp-at-umich.edu to request your
          name be added to a list for winter term.
