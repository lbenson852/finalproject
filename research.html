      <h4>
        Thank you to those of you who have emailed me asking about research
        opportunities or to join my lab. I teach full-time, and so I do not
        conduct regular research. I do not have a research lab, nor do I have
        any research openings at this time.

      <h3>philosophy</h3>
      <h4>
        I like to use a combination of physical experiments and computer
        simulation to solve engineering problems. Physical experiments can more
        closely represent what is happening in a system, but simulation will let
        you see inside that system and visualize specific relationships or data
        that you would not be able to get otherwise. It's a win-win! And by
        "physical experiments" I don't just mean making waves in the towing
        tank. If you're in my class, you're probably helping me run an
        experiment, too! I am also a big proponent of open source software. If
        you don't already know
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, stop reading
        this and go learn it right now.

      <h3>active areas of research</h3>
      <h4>
        I am not very good at settling down to one topic of research. There are
        just too many interesting problems to solve! This is what I'm currently
        working on, though.

        effects of project-based learning and teams on first-year undergraduate
        engineering students
      </h5>
      <h4>
        I have taught a first-year intro to engineering course for many years,
        and we are always fiddling with it and trying to make it a better
        course. Recently, my co-instructors and I decided to begin assessing
        whether our chosen approaches are working or not. We frequently present
        at the <a href="http://www.asee.org/">ASEE</a> annual conference. I am a
        faculty collaborator on <a href="tandem.html">Tandem</a>, a team support
        tool being developed by U-M's Center for Academic Innovation.

      <h5>
        effects of implicit bias on obstacles to student learning (or, as I like
        to call it, "How Not to Be a Primitive Asshole")
      </h5>
      <h4>
        Implicit biases are biases we have for or against people and things...
        but we don't know we have these biases. We absorb them through the
        societies that we move through. An unknown bias can put you in
        uncomfortable situations by, essentially, making you act like an
        ignorant idiot when consciously you definitely know better. By
        recognizing potential implicit biases, we can bring our brains into the
        21st century and make working with each other way more easier and a lot
        more fun.

        These are some things I've worked on in the past. They'll probably
        resurface in the future, too. Circle of life and all that.

        hydrodynamics of marine structures
      </h5>
      <h4>
        I conducted research on the hydrodynamics of a variety of marine
        structures. Everything from Navy ships to fish spawning reefs. I
        primarily used <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFOAM</a> to
        simulate the fluid flow and around structures. The simulations were
        validated against real world data such as model tests, ship sea trials,
        or river flow data.

      <h5>
        design loads for ships and marine structures using probabilistic methods
      </h5>
      <h4>
        My dissertation work centered on using extreme value theory to generate
        extreme ship responses in a rational way. The details are
        <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/58469">here</a>.
        In short, waves that might be dangerous for one ship might NOT be
        dangerous for a different type of ship. This approach uses what we know
        about a given ship's movement in waves to find the waves that will cause
        big motions of the ship so that you only have to simulate a few cases to
        produce the extreme stresses the ship or structure will see. This
        information can then be handed off to the structural engineers so the
        ship structure can be designed to withstand these design loads. My
        original method was improved by the student following me, Dae-Hyun Kim,
        and the details of his work are
        <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/96135">here</a>.
        The result is what we call the Design Loads Generator (DLG), and it runs
        very quickly because it is based on linear theory. The output of the DLG
        are sets of wave conditions that will lead to linear-based extreme
        responses. Unfortunately, the entire world is nonlinear. So, we take the
        DLG wave conditions and run them through high fidelity nonlinear codes,
        such as OpenFOAM, to generate more accurate maps of pressure and stress
        on the marine structure.

      <h5>microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes</h5>
      <h4>
        I grew up in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, MI, and the Great Lakes have
        always been near and dear to my heart. When I stumbled on the issue of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics"
          >microplastic pollution</a
        >, I decided I needed to act. After all, engineering is causing this
        problem, so engineering ought to help solve it! At
        <a href="http://iaglr.org/">IAGLR</a> 2014, I chaired a session on
        microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes, and we brought together many
        of the active researchers in this area. This session also supported
        NOAA's
        <a
          href="https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/regional-coordination/great-lakes-action-plan"
          >Great Lakes Land-based Marine Debris Action Plan</a
        >
        . In 2016, I was part of
        <a href="https://exxpedition.com/">eXXpedition</a>Great Lakes 2016, in
        which researchers all around the Great Lakes sampled for microplastics.
